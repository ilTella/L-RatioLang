# L+RatioLang

This is a humorous esoteric language based on the "L + ratio + ..." copypastas well known on the Internet,
which mock the typical conversations between terminally online Twitter users by exaggerating them.

With this little joke of a language, complete with a full documentation, you will be able to write a simple program using
only silly insults and buzzwords.

As it is a language based on virtual taunts and mockery, it may be somewhat offensive to some, so take this as a disclaimer.

Have fun!
